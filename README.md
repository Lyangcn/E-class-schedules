# 电子课程表 (E-class-schedules)
源自于柳州市铁一中学初中部2418班的电子课程表

# 为何要制作此软件？
直接把课程表写在黑板上会占用部分黑板空间，还需要每天手动更改课程表，显得有些麻烦。突然就有了把课程表显示在电脑上的想法。

# 开源许可证？

# E-class-schedules
Originated from the electronic curriculum of Class 2418 of the junior high school of Liuzhou Tieyi Middle School

# Why did you make this software?
Writing the class schedule directly on the blackboard will take up part of the blackboard space, and you need to manually change the class schedule every day, which is a bit troublesome. Suddenly, the idea of displaying the class schedule on the computer came to mind.

# Open source license?
It is planned to use a BSD or LGPL license
